## 🛡️ Abstract
In the modern labor market, "Resume Harvesting" has become a significant vector for data privacy violations. V.I.P.E.R. is a forensic auditing tool designed to analyze recruitment communications. It uses linguistic pattern matching and heuristic logic to differentiate between legitimate retained searches and predatory "Body Shop" schemes (Tier 3 agencies) that harvest personal data without valid client contracts.

## 🚀 Usage
1.  **Paste** the suspicious email text into the analyzer.
2.  **Input** the sender's email address (optional but recommended).
3.  **Run Audit.** The system will flag high-risk indicators (e.g., "Right to Represent" demands, known offshore staffing hubs, and keyword stuffing).

## ⚖️ Sovereign AI Statement
Cata Risk Lab believes in **Labor Sovereignty**. A professional's curriculum vitae is personal data. Predatory harvesting of this data for database training or quota-filling violates the dignity of the worker. This tool is released Open Source to empower individuals to protect their digital identity.
